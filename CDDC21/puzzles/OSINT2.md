TeslaReactor7 seems to be one of the GDC cybots. One of TheKeepers founded a strange video on his YouTube channel. Can you track him down?

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

We found the YouTube channel going by the name of Tesla Reactor, and found that he had left his email account in the about page.

From there, we used [ghunt.py](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt). We found that Tesla Reactor wrote a review in a cocktail bar with the flag in plaintext.
