## Solution

The original ip address takes us to 10.8.202.2:5000/home, and we find a comment: `<!--TOP SECRET ACCESS POINT: /SHA256(ROUTE) in LOWERCASE-->` in the HTML.

We use SHA256 on the word "home" and we get brought to a "Super Top Secret Page".

Thinking that it might be possible for SHA256 to be used for other access points, we used python to convert the common.txt file wordlist into SHA256, then run it in Gobuster.

We come across a SHA256-ed manual page, and get a manual.txt file, with some of the access points.

From forum, we find that in the HTML, there is a unencrypted JS code telling us how the routes of the forum worked.

Basically, it was just running the SHA256 function on the path `forum/<post_id>`. The post ids shown were post2, post3, post4, post5, and missing post1.

We suspected it to be a deleted post which could be of importance to us, so we ran the SHA256 function, getting the url: 10.8.202.2:5000/SHA256(forum/post1), where 'SHA256(forum/post1)' is replaced by the actual SHA256-ed hash.
