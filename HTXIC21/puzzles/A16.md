# A16 - Find the malicious attacks by Revo Force

## CATEGORY

## Challenge

The cybersecurity team has managed to identify some suspicious activities within the network traffic data (labelled as "malicious" under "label" column). They intend to use the Digital Red Light (DTRL) cameras to help them with their investigation, i.e. to check for suspicious people lurking around the location where the most of these attacks occur.

Download the attached files to work on them. You are to identify the location where most of the attacks occur based on the most common src_ip (Source IP) and identify the number of cameras within 1.3km radius of that location that they can use for their investigation.

The flag and solution is the number of cameras.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

Provided files: Network traffic data: 5 excel files; IP addresses' coordinates: 1 excel file; DTRL cameras location: 1 set of shp files

1. Process network traffic data. Highest count of source IP is from 786.

2. Find the location corresponding to IP of 786:

  786	1.327187	103.946316

3. Find the number of DTRL cameras in 1.3km radius using Google Earth. Answer is 2.
