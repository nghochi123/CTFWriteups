# A16 - Find the malicious attacks by Revo Force

## CATEGORY

## Challenge

The cybersecurity team has managed to identify some suspicious activities within the network traffic data (labelled as "malicious" under "label" column). They intend to use the Digital Red Light (DTRL) cameras to help them with their investigation, i.e. to check for suspicious people lurking around the location where the most of these attacks occur.

Download the attached files to work on them. You are to identify the location where most of the attacks occur based on the most common src_ip (Source IP) and identify the number of cameras within 1.3km radius of that location that they can use for their investigation.

The flag and solution is the number of cameras.

## Hint(s)
