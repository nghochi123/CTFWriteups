## Challenge

Another image was found in the web server directory of the defaced website and it can't be opened by any file viewer(s). The image has been extracted out. Find a way to view the file and find the secret.

The flag will appear in the following format: htx{String}.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

```
import random
import argparse

def encrypt(path = "./qr_enc.png", path_out = "./result.txt"):

# Reading the file and generating an array

arr = []
with open(path, 'rb') as file:
    while line := file.read(16):
        arr.append(bytearray(line))

# Encrypting the data column by column

for col in range(16):
    temp = [190-137, 118-80, 165-78, 107-71, 154-13, 186-10, 60-26, 60-10, 110-78, 121-68, 240-174, 166-66, 2-96, 83-130, 12-68, 38-82]
    n = temp[col]
    for row in range(len(arr)):
        try:
            arr[row][col] = (arr[row][col] - n)%256
        except Exception as e:
            continue
            #print(e)

# Writing the output into a new file

with open(path_out, 'wb') as file:
    for row in arr:
        file.write(bytearray(row))

encrypt()
```

## Flag
