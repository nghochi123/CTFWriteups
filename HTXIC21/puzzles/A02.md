# A02 - Bit Shifting

## CATEGORY

Reverse Engineering

## Challenge

Another image was found in the web server directory of the defaced website and it can't be opened by any file viewer(s). The image has been extracted out. Find a way to view the file and find the secret.

The flag will appear in the following format: htx{String}.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

A encryptor (python file) and a png file are provided, suggesting that the image was passed through this encryptor and we have to reverse the process.

The python file arranges the bytes of the input file in 16 columns. For each column it adds a random integer n in (0,255) to all elements and apply modulo 256.

PNG files have the same 16 bytes of data at the beginning, so by computing the difference, we obtain the value of n used for each column. Then we change the + to -. 


```
import random
import argparse

def encrypt(path = "./qr_enc.png", path_out = "./result.txt"):

# Reading the file and generating an array

arr = []
with open(path, 'rb') as file:
    while line := file.read(16):
        arr.append(bytearray(line))

# Encrypting the data column by column

for col in range(16):
    # Originally n = randint(0,255)
    temp = [190-137, 118-80, 165-78, 107-71, 154-13, 186-10, 60-26, 60-10, 110-78, 121-68, 240-174, 166-66, 2-96, 83-130, 12-68, 38-82]
    n = temp[col]
    for row in range(len(arr)):
        try:
            # Originally arr[row][col] = (arr[row][col] + n)%256
            arr[row][col] = (arr[row][col] - n)%256
        except Exception as e:
            continue
            #print(e)

# Writing the output into a new file

with open(path_out, 'wb') as file:
    for row in arr:
        file.write(bytearray(row))

encrypt()
```

## Flag

Decoded file is png of a QR code.
