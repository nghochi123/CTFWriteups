# C77 - XSS 1

## CATEGORY

Web - XSS

## Challenge

It seems that the website has a lot of web application vulnerabilities. Try out the other common types of web application attacks to see if there are more hidden secrets.

The flag will appear in the following format: HTX{String}.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

Logging into the nomral user page (not admin), we navigate to the booking page and attempt to book a slot. The "Title" and "Description" fields are suceptible to XSS attacks, and the flag is set as a variable `flag`.

We input the command `<script>alert(flag)</script>` which gives us the flag.

## Flag

- Did not take down
