# C68 - Identify the bomb making lab 2

## CATEGORY

Crypto

## Challenge

There appears to be a notebook belonging to the terrorists inside the safe. However, parts of the book are encrypted in a cipher. The only clue left behind is a keyword "djyespdtd" and the phrase "you Sum, you Shift, you Dcode". Perhaps the pin from the safe can help.

The flag is the correctly decrypted keyword.

You are only given 2 attempts for this challenge. Completing this challenge will unlock C69.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

From the previous challenge, the PIN is 3233. The sum is 11. The phrase gives a hint - "shift", and we tried ROT 11. ROT 11 worked in the reverse direction and we got the word "synthesis" which was our flag.

## Flag
