## Hint(s)

~~Blessing of Rawnyogn~~

## Solution

First line ROT13 to 'headsfirstthentails'. Notice that second line has 20 characters = 4 x 5. One idea was to use 'heads' and 'tails' as keys in two layers of encrytion.

Transposition decoding with 'tails' then 'heads'. Correct 'Read by row/column' options were brute forced.
