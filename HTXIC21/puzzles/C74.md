# C74 - SQL Injection 1

## CATEGORY

Web - SQLI

## Challenge

Upon arrival at the room in the hideout location, you see a login webpage displayed on the computer screen. However, you do not have the credentials for it. Find a way to gain access to the website.

The flag will appear in the following format: HTX{String}.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

Navigating to the login page and using the prompt "SQLI" as a guide, we type in `' or 1=1 #` into the username textbox. (`' or 1=1 --` doesn't work) This gives us access to one of the accounts where we can see the flag.

## Flag

HTX{Welcome_to_HIC_2021}
