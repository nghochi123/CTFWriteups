# A04 - QR Secret

## CATEGORY

QR code fixing

## Challenge

On the defaced website, there seems to be an incomplete QR code that encodes a very important password. However, the QR code seems to have encoded a password which can't be read by a normal QR code reader. Fix the QR code to reveal the passowrd.

The flag will appear in the following format: htx{String}

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

We used qrazybox to decode the qr code message. The resultant obtained data bits was then thrown into dcode and the flag was obtained.

## Flag

htx{Qr_S3kr3t_i5_sp00ky}
