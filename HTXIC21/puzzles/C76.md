# C76 - SQL Injection 3

## CATEGORY

Web - SQLI

## Challenge

The web application seems to have more hidden privileged users than the default administrators. Try to retrieve some privileged usernames and passwords other than Administrator.

The flag will appear in the following format: HTX{String}.

## Hint(s)

None used.

## Solution

Logging in to the normal user's account with the method in C74, we navigate back to the login page instead of logging out. We then navigate into the MANAGEMENT login page and just click login with empty username and password fields.

This somehow gives us access to an admin account and we get the flag HTX{Admin_101}

## Flag

HTX{Admin_101}
